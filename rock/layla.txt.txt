Layla
Eric Clapton

What will you do when you get lonely
No one's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging darling please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Tried to give you consolation
When your old man, he let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging darling please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
Or tell me all my love's in vain

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
Begging darling please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
