​the boy is mine
Ariana Grande

How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic, so independent
Tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine, mine

Something about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (oh my)
And God knows I'm trying
But there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let, let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't bеlieve my mind
The boy is divine
The boy is mine

Please, know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
Say it's fine (it's fine)
Happens all the time, 'ime

Something about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (oh my)
And God knows I'm trying
But there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let, let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
The boy is

And I know it's simply meant to be and I
I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you I'm not usually
Like this, shit, it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy

The boy is mine (oh)
I can't wait to try him
Let, let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
The boy is mine
